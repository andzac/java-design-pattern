# Facade Pattern
	- purpose: 
	- allow a complex interface be easy to use defining a simple interface as a layer to the complex interface.
	- it decouples a client from a subsystem
	- a client send a request to the facade that forward it to the appropriate sub-system
	- is possible change functionalities on client (using facade class) without modify the sub-system
